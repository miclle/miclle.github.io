Alright, HTML5 has been released for quite a while now, and its 

capabilities never cease to amaze me. Here, I have got 10 more HTML and 

Javascript demonstrations that show you what they can do. Back to few 

years ago, implementation of these kind of animations are simply 

impossible and only can be done with Flash, but now, look at them, 

impressive animations and effects!

I have done a few posts before this, just in case you've missed the 

previous display of the awesomeness of HTML5 and Javascript, here is the

lists, make sure you check them out:

*[10 Awesome HTML5, CSS and Javascript Demonstrations](http://www.queness.com/post/3759/10-awesome-html5-css-and-javascript-demonstrations)Personally, I like Blob, keylight and noise field a lot, what do you think?

*[Breathing Galaxies](http://mudcu.be/labs/JS1k/BreathingGalaxies.html)

![Breathing Galaxies](http://www.queness.com/resources/images/chomexp2/1.jpg)

Hypotrochoid with dynamically changing color and diameter. Use the

keyboard to change shapes mid-stream, or move the mouse to create a new

shape.

*[Noise Field](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/demos/processing_js/noisefield08.html)

![Noise Field](http://www.queness.com/resources/images/chomexp2/2.jpg)

Particle trails via Perlin noise. Move mouse to change particle motion. Click to randomize parameters.

*[Keylight](http://hakim.se/experiments/html5/keylight/03/)

![Keylight](http://www.queness.com/resources/images/chomexp2/3.jpg)

A playhead travels between keys which resonate in different sounds depending on where they are placed.

*[Swirling Tentacles](http://acko.net/dumpx/996b.html)

![Swirling Tentacles](http://www.queness.com/resources/images/chomexp2/4.jpg)

Pulsing 3d wires with color cycling and camera tweening, in 1k of JavaScript.

*[FlowerPower](http://www.openrise.com/lab/FlowerPower/)

![FlowerPower](http://www.queness.com/resources/images/chomexp2/5.jpg)

Another experiment inspired by nature - simple drawing tool with flowers as brushes using bezier curves.

*[Blob](http://hakim.se/experiments/html5/blob/03/)

![Blob](http://www.queness.com/resources/images/chomexp2/6.jpg)

A soft blob that can be thrown around the screen so that it 

bounces against the browser window. The blob can also be split (double 

click) into many blobs, the smaller blobs will merge into a single 

bigger blob if they collide.

*[Rotating Spiral](http://homepage.mac.com/chriswjohnson/automatons/rotating-spiral-1.svg)

![Rotating Spiral](http://www.queness.com/resources/images/chomexp2/7.jpg)

You are getting sleepy, very sleepy.... A resolution independent 

rotating spiral – simple, but visually compelling. Click to start, stop,

and reverse the rotation.

*[Magnetic](http://hakim.se/experiments/html5/magnetic/02/)

![Magnetic](http://www.queness.com/resources/images/chomexp2/8.jpg)

Magnetic points are used to control a flow of particles. If there 

are many particles orbiting a magnet, it will radiate color and increase

in size.

*[Trail](http://hakim.se/experiments/html5/trail/03/)

![Trail](http://www.queness.com/resources/images/chomexp2/9.jpg)

Colorful particles follow and rotate around the mouse position to generate an organic trail which then fades out slowly.

*[Graph Layout](http://canvas-test.appspot.com/)

![Graph Layout](http://www.queness.com/resources/images/chomexp2/10.jpg)

An interactive force-directed graph layout.
